'Here is a VBA Function that I wrote that is pretty clean:

Public Function CleanString(ByVal strSource As String, ByVal strCharToClean As String) As String
Dim arrRemove() As String
Dim strOut As String
Dim iChar1 As Long
Dim iChar2 As Long

ReDim arrRemove(Len(strCharToClean))

For iChar1 = 0 To UBound(arrRemove)
arrRemove(iChar1) = Mid(strCharToClean, iChar1 + 1, 1)
Next
arrRemove(UBound(arrRemove)) = Chr(34)
For iChar1 = 1 To Len(strSource)
bFound = False
For iChar2 = LBound(arrRemove) To UBound(arrRemove)
If Mid(strSource, iChar1, 1) = arrRemove(iChar2) Then
bFound = True
Exit For
End If
Next
If Not bFound Then
strOut = strOut & Mid(strSource, iChar1, 1)
End If
Next
CleanString = strOut
End Function
